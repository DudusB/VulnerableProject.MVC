# Exposing Database Credentials
This vulnerability demonstrates the risk of storing database credentials in plaintext within the appsettings.json configuration file and accessing them directly in the application code. The credentials are then displayed on a webpage, exposing them in the application environment.

Credentials are exposed at:
https://localhost:44367/Home/Index

| File | Description|
|----|-----|
|HomeController.cs	| Retrieves database credentials from configuration and handles them within the application logic.|
|Index.cshtml	| View that displays the database credentials.|

#### Steps to Reproduce
Database Credentials in Configuration:

Credentials are stored unencrypted in appsettings.json, making them vulnerable to disclosure if the file is accessed.
Accessing and Displaying Credentials:

The application reads these credentials directly and displays them on the Home page, demonstrating the ease of exposure.
Example Access
Navigate to the Home controller's Index action to see the database credentials displayed:

https://localhost:44367/Home/Index

Credentials are displayed as:

Username: admin
Password: admin1234

# Outdated Hashing Algorithm

This vulnerability demonstrates the risk of using an outdated hashing algorithm (SHA1) for password storage. SHA1 is prone to collision attacks and is considered deprecated for cryptographic purposes.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Password Hashing with SHA1**:
   - The `AccountController` initializes with a SHA1 hashed password (`adminPassword` is set to "1").
   - The SHA1 hash is calculated in the constructor and stored.

2. **Login Process Using SHA1**:
   - The `Login` POST action hashes the input password using SHA1 and compares it to the stored hash.
   - Successful login occurs when the hashes match, demonstrating the vulnerability as SHA1 should not be used for secure password storage.

#### Example Access

Navigate to the Account controller's Login action by visiting:

https://localhost:44367/Account/Login

Enter the following credentials to test the SHA1 hashing:

- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: 1

The password will be hashed using SHA1, and if it matches the pre-computed hash, access is granted, exposing the security risk associated with using outdated hashing algorithms.

This setup provides a clear demonstration of how an outdated hashing method can be integrated and identified in an application, suitable for testing the effectiveness of SAST tools in recognizing vulnerable cryptographic practices.

## Vulnerability Documentation: Hardcoded Encryption Key

This vulnerability highlights the risk associated with embedding a symmetric encryption key directly in the source code. It is a common security flaw that could allow an attacker to decrypt sensitive data if they gain access to the source code.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Hardcoded AES Key**:
   - An AES symmetric key is hardcoded in the `AccountSessionController` class. This key is used to encrypt sensitive information, such as passwords.

2. **Encryption Process**:
   - The `Login` GET action uses the hardcoded AES key to encrypt a password, which is then displayed in the view as a base64 encoded string.

#### Example Access

Navigate to the Account controller's Login action to observe the encrypted password being displayed:

https://localhost:44367/Account/Login

The displayed encrypted password is a base64 string, resulting from the encryption of the password '1' using the hardcoded AES key.

This setup is a demonstration of how encryption keys should not be hardcoded in the source code and should help in evaluating the ability of SAST tools to detect such practices.

##  Insecure Key Storage

This vulnerability involves the insecure storage of cryptographic keys (both public and private) within a publicly accessible directory of the application. Storing keys in such a location can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Key Generation and Storage**:
   - RSA public and private keys are generated and stored in plaintext format within the `wwwroot/keys` directory, which is accessible from the web.

2. **Accessing Keys**:
   - The keys are accessible by navigating to the URLs provided by the server that correspond to the file paths. For example, `https://localhost:44367/keys/publicKey.xml` and `https://localhost:44367/keys/privateKey.xml`.

#### Example Access

Access the public and private keys using the following URLs:

- **Public Key**: https://localhost:44367/keys/publicKey.xml
- **Private Key**: https://localhost:44367/keys/privateKey.xml

This example demonstrates a severe security flaw where sensitive cryptographic keys are not only stored improperly but are also made accessible via the web. This setup serves to highlight the importance of secure key management and storage practices and can be used to test the effectiveness of security tools in detecting such vulnerabilities.

## Weak Random Number Generator

#### Vulnerability Documentation: Weak Random Number Generator

This vulnerability demonstrates the use of a non-cryptographically secure random number generator (`System.Random`) in a context where cryptographic strength is required, leading to predictable outcomes that could be exploited by attackers.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Weak Random Number Generation**:
   - The `HomeController` includes an action method `WeakRandomNumber` that generates a "random" token using `System.Random`, which is inappropriate for secure cryptographic operations.

2. **Displaying Generated Token**:
   - The token generated by the weak random number generator is displayed on a webpage, highlighting how such tokens might be used in practice, for example, as session identifiers or temporary passwords.

#### Example Access

Navigate to the Home controller's `WeakRandomNumber` action to see the weakly generated random token displayed:

https://localhost:44367/Home/WeakRandomNumber

The generated token will be displayed, demonstrating how using a weak random number generator can result in insecure cryptographic operations.

This documentation and example setup highlight a common security flaw and can be used to educate developers about the importance of using appropriate cryptographic libraries for security-sensitive operations.

##  Non-SSL HTTP Connection

(non ssl webistes overview: https://badssl.com/)

#### Vulnerability Documentation: Non-SSL HTTP Connection

This vulnerability showcases the risk of transmitting sensitive data over an unsecured HTTP connection, which does not encrypt the data, thereby exposing it to potential interception and misuse.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Non-SSL HTTP Connection**:
   - The `HomeController` includes an action method `SendSensitiveData` that sends user credentials over an HTTP connection, clearly demonstrating the lack of transport security.

2. **Displaying Server Response**:
   - The response from the server is displayed on a webpage, illustrating how the transmitted data could be exposed during transmission.

#### Example Access

Navigate to the Home controller's `SendSensitiveData` action to initiate the transfer of sensitive data over an HTTP connection:

https://localhost:44367/Home/SendSensitiveDataNonSsl

This setup effectively demonstrates a common security flaw where sensitive data is transmitted over an unsecured channel. It is a valuable example for security training and testing the ability of network monitoring tools to detect unsecured transmissions of sensitive data.

## Disable SSL Certificate Validation

Disabling SSL certificate validation in HTTPS connections compromises the security of data in transit by accepting any SSL certificate provided by the server, regardless of its validity. This practice can lead to severe security breaches, including man-in-the-middle attacks.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. **HttpClient Configuration**:
   - The `HttpClient` used in the `HomeController` is configured with an `HttpClientHandler` that disables SSL certificate validation. This is demonstrated in the `SendSensitiveData` method which sends sensitive data over an ostensibly secure HTTPS connection that doesn't verify the authenticity of the server's SSL certificate.

2. **Testing the Vulnerability**:
   - When the `SendSensitiveData` action is invoked, it connects to an HTTPS endpoint without verifying the SSL certificate, showing how data could be exposed to potential interception.

#### Example Access

Navigate to the following URL to initiate a data send operation that demonstrates the vulnerability:

https://localhost:44367/Home/SendSensitiveDataSslValidOff

This example action sends data to an HTTPS endpoint without SSL certificate validation, illustrating a critical and common security misconfiguration. This scenario is crucial for educational purposes, highlighting the need for proper SSL certificate validation in all secure communications.

## Log PII Without Sanitization

This vulnerability involves logging sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as patient data, directly to log outputs (console or files) without sanitizing the data to protect privacy. This poses a significant risk of exposing sensitive information.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. **PII Logging**:
   - The `HomeController` includes an action method `LogPatientData` that logs patient data including name, age, gender (including non-binary), and medical conditions directly to the application's logs.

2. **Accessing and Displaying Patient Data**:
   - When the `LogPatientData` action is triggered, it logs detailed patient information to the server logs, which might be accessible to unauthorized users or could be exposed during data breaches.

#### Example Access

Navigate to the Home controller's `LogPatientData` action to trigger the logging of sensitive data:

https://localhost:44367/Home/LogPatientData

Logged data can be seen in browser console or in ./Test-WebGoat.netCore-Extended/src/Sast.DIERS.Test.MVC/logs/Sast.Diers.Test.MVC.txt

This action will log the patient information, and the webpage will confirm that the data has been logged. This example illustrates how sensitive data should be handled with care to prevent accidental exposure through logs or other unsecured outputs.

## PII in URL Query Parameters

Sending PII through URL query parameters poses a significant security risk. URLs can be logged in server logs, stored in browser history, cached by browsers, and might be exposed in referrer headers, leading to potential data leaks.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Generating and Sending PII**:
   - The `HomeController` includes an action method `SendPatientData` which generates random patient names and ages, and sends these data along with gender as query parameters to another action method.

2. **Receiving and Logging PII**:
   - Another action method `ReceivePatientData` receives this data through query parameters and logs them, demonstrating how easily accessible these data are.

#### Example Access

To see the vulnerability in action, navigate to the following URL to trigger the generation and transmission of PII in query parameters:

https://localhost:44367/Home/SendPatientData

The above URL will redirect to `ReceivePatientData` with the patient data in the URL, which is logged on the server and displayed on the page.

### Security Recommendations

- **Avoid Sending Sensitive Data in URLs**: Always use secure methods like POST requests with HTTPS to transmit sensitive data.
- **Logging Practices**: Ensure that logging mechanisms do not inadvertently log sensitive data from URLs.
- **Data Protection Measures**: Implement data protection measures like encryption and use secure session management techniques to handle sensitive data more safely.

This approach and documentation provide a clear demonstration of how PII should not be handled in web applications and serve as a guide to secure best practices.

## Vulnerability Documentation: Embedding a Private Key in Source Code

Embedding a private key directly in the source code poses a significant security risk. If the source code is shared, stored in a version control system, or accessed by unauthorized users, the private key can be easily exposed, leading to potential security breaches.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Embedding the Private Key**:
   - The `SecurityController` includes an action method `ShowPrivateKey` which embeds a private key directly in the source code. This private key is then logged and displayed on the webpage.

2. **Accessing and Displaying the Private Key**:
   - The `ShowPrivateKey` action method logs the private key to the console and displays it on a view, demonstrating how easily accessible this sensitive information is when embedded in source code.

#### Example Access

To see the vulnerability in action, navigate to the following URL to access the action that exposes the private key:

https://localhost:44367/Security/ShowPrivateKey

This URL will display the private key on the page and log it to the console, clearly illustrating the risk of embedding sensitive information directly in source code.

## Improperly Secure the Transmission of a Private Key Over the Network

Transmitting a private key over a non-encrypted channel (HTTP) poses a significant security risk. If the data is intercepted during transmission, unauthorized parties can gain access to sensitive information, leading to potential security breaches.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Transmit the Private Key**:
   - The `SecurityController` includes an action method `TransmitPrivateKey` that sends a private key over an insecure HTTP connection to a specified URL.

2. **Observe the Insecure Transmission**:
   - Navigate to the provided URL to trigger the transmission of the private key. The key will be sent over an unencrypted channel, illustrating the vulnerability.

#### Example Access

To see the vulnerability in action, navigate to the following URL to trigger the transmission of the private key over an insecure channel:

https://localhost:44367/Security/TransmitPrivateKey

The above URL demonstrates how the private key is transmitted over an insecure channel and the response from the server is displayed.
