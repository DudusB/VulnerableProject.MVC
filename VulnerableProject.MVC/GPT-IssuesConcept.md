To create an ASP.NET MVC project with deliberately introduced vulnerabilities for SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools testing, I will outline the setup for each of the requested vulnerability types. These vulnerabilities should cover passwords and hardcoded secrets, issues with encryption and hashing, handling of SSL/non-SSL connections, exposure of personally identifiable information (PII), and improper use of certificate pairs. Here's how you can set up each:

### 1. Passwords and Hardcoded Secrets
- **Vulnerability 1**: Store a hardcoded password within your application code.
- **Vulnerability 2**: Embed an API key directly in your source code.
- **Vulnerability 3**: Place database credentials in a configuration file without encryption.

### 2. Cyphers/Hashers/Crypto
- **Vulnerability 4**: Use an outdated hashing algorithm (e.g., MD5 or SHA1) for password storage.
- **Vulnerability 5**: Encrypt data using a hardcoded symmetric key that is visible in the source code.
- **Vulnerability 6**: Utilize a weak random number generator for cryptographic operations.

### 3. SSL/Non-SSL Connections
- **Vulnerability 7**: Establish a non-SSL HTTP connection to transfer sensitive data.
- **Vulnerability 8**: Disable SSL certificate validation in an HTTPS connection.

### 4. Leak of Personally Identifiable Information
- **Vulnerability 9**: Log PII to standard output or log files without sanitization.
- **Vulnerability 10**: Include PII in URL query parameters.

### 5. Using Provided Certificates in a Way That Exposes the Private Key
- **Vulnerability 11**: Store a private key in a publicly accessible location (e.g., within a web-accessible directory).
- **Vulnerability 12**: Embed a private key directly in source code.
- **Vulnerability 13**: Improperly secure the transmission of a private key over the network (e.g., using a non-encrypted channel).

### Implementation Setup in an ASP.NET MVC Project
Here is a basic guide on setting up the project and where to place the code for each vulnerability:

1. **Create a new ASP.NET MVC Project**:
   - Use Visual Studio or the .NET CLI to create a new ASP.NET MVC project.
   ```bash
   dotnet new mvc -n VulnerableAspNetApp
   ```

2. **Add Vulnerabilities**:
   - For hardcoded secrets (Vulnerabilities 1-3), add them in `HomeController.cs` or any controller you prefer.
   - For cryptographic issues (Vulnerabilities 4-6), implement these in a new class, `CryptoHelper.cs`, under the `Helpers` directory.
   - For SSL/non-SSL issues (Vulnerabilities 7-8), configure this in `Startup.cs` or within specific controller actions that make external calls.
   - For exposing PII (Vulnerabilities 9-10), handle these in `UserController.cs`, simulating operations involving user data.
   - For certificate mismanagement (Vulnerabilities 11-13), use `CertificateHelper.cs` in the `Helpers` directory to manage certificate storage and transmission.

3. **Project Structure**:
   - Organize your project files and directories based on the functionalities. Keep security-related utilities in the `Helpers` folder.

This setup will provide a range of vulnerabilities for effective SAST tool testing. If you need detailed implementation code for specific vulnerabilities or have more precise requirements, let me know, and I can provide tailored code examples.
